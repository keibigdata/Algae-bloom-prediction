Building a Deep Learning-Based Green Algae Prediction Pipeline for MLOps
- Research Objectives
  - The need to evolve the existing developed green algae prediction algorithm into a continuous analysis algorithm to enhance the policy utility of research outcomes
  - Development-centered research for the periodic scheduling of prediction algorithms
- Research Methods
  - Based on the chlorophyll-a prediction algorithm developed in 2019, the prediction model was reorganized to enable periodized predictions.
  - Periodization of predictions by building a data pipeline for the data collection-analysis-result derivation process of deep learning-based green algae prediction algorithm

- Pipeline Development Results
  - Building a data automation pipeline through Open API 
  - Designing REST API for green algae prediction
  - Real-time chlorophyll forecast from 16 stations in 7 days
  - Providing specific examples of how artificial intelligence can contribute to solving environmental problems
